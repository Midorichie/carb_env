# Carbon Credit Trading Blockchain

This project implements a basic blockchain system for carbon credit trading and environmental sustainability. It allows companies to trade carbon credits transparently and efficiently, aiming to reduce overall emissions.

## Features

- Basic blockchain structure
- Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism
- Carbon credit transactions between entities
- Balance checking for addresses
- Chain validation

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Midorichie/carbon-credit-blockchain.git
   cd carbon-credit-blockchain
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the example usage:

```python
python carbon_credit_blockchain.py
```

This will create a blockchain, perform some sample transactions, and display the balances of different entities.

## Project Structure

- `carbon_credit_blockchain.py`: Main script containing the `Block` and `Blockchain` classes
- `README.md`: This file, containing project information and instructions

## How it Works

1. The `Block` class represents individual blocks in the blockchain, containing transactions and other metadata.
2. The `Blockchain` class manages the chain of blocks and handles transactions.
3. Transactions represent the transfer of carbon credits between entities.
4. Mining adds new blocks to the chain, using a Proof-of-Work mechanism to ensure integrity.
5. The system allows checking balances and validating the entire blockchain.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced carbon credit-specific features
- Improve the consensus mechanism
- Add a user interface for easier interaction
- Implement smart contracts for automated trading and verification
- Enhance security and privacy features
